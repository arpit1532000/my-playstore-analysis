# Play Store Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Google Play Store data. The aim is to extract meaningful insights and trends from the dataset to understand the app ecosystem better. The analysis covers various app attributes such as categories, ratings, reviews, installs, types, prices, content ratings, and more.

## Files in the Repository
- **My_Play_store_data_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete EDA process, including data loading, cleaning, visualization, and insights generation.

## Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, data cleaning, and formatting.
2. **Univariate Analysis**: Study individual app attributes like ratings, price distributions, and install counts.
3. **Bivariate Analysis**: Investigate relationships between variables, such as ratings vs. category, installs vs. price, etc.
4. **Data Visualization**: Use graphical methods to represent insights clearly.
5. **Conclusion and Business Insights**: Provide actionable insights based on the findings from the analysis.

## Key Steps
1. **Data Collection**: The dataset is obtained from the Google Play Store.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Missing values, duplicate entries, and formatting issues are addressed.
3. **Data Exploration**: Explore key variables and relationships between them.
4. **Data Visualization**: Insights are presented through various plots, such as bar charts, scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots.

## Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the Jupyter notebook:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy`: For numerical operations
- `matplotlib`: For plotting
- `seaborn`: For advanced visualizations

You can install these libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook My_Play_store_data_analysis.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to replicate the analysis.

## Results
- Summary statistics for various app attributes.
- Insights into app categories and their performance in terms of ratings and installs.
- Visualized relationships between price and rating, reviews and installs, etc.
- Recommendations for developers on pricing strategies, category selection, and review management based on analysis.

## Future Work
- **Advanced Analysis**: Perform deeper analyses using machine learning models to predict app success.
- **Time-Series Analysis**: Investigate how app trends change over time.
- **User Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze user reviews to gain insights into user satisfaction.
